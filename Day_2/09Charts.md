---

## 8. Stacked Bar / Column Chart
- **Description:** Bars are divided into subcategories to show the contribution of each part to the whole.  
- **Analysis:** Compares both total and individual category contributions across multiple groups.  
- **Uses:** Product sales by region, revenue breakdown by department.  
- **Advantages:** Displays composition and comparison simultaneously.  
- **Disadvantages:** Can be confusing if too many subcategories; differences may be hard to interpret.

---

## 9. Stacked Area Chart
- **Description:** Multiple area charts stacked to show cumulative totals and individual series contributions.  
- **Analysis:** Demonstrates how each component contributes to overall trends over time.  
- **Uses:** Revenue breakdown over months, web traffic sources, population by region.  
- **Advantages:** Visualizes composition over time; emphasizes overall growth or decline.  
- **Disadvantages:** Hard to interpret individual series if areas overlap.

---

## 10. Combination Chart (Bar + Line)
- **Description:** Combines two or more chart types to represent multiple datasets in one chart.  
- **Analysis:** Useful for comparing related metrics, such as absolute values and trends.  
- **Uses:** Revenue (bars) vs profit margin (line), targets vs actual performance.  
- **Advantages:** Provides multiple insights in a single chart; flexible.  
- **Disadvantages:** Can be visually complex; may require explanation.

---

## 11. Waterfall Chart
- **Description:** Shows cumulative effect of sequential positive and negative values.  
- **Analysis:** Helps understand how each value contributes to a final total.  
- **Uses:** Profit/loss analysis, financial statements, budget changes.  
- **Advantages:** Clearly demonstrates step-by-step changes.  
- **Disadvantages:** Not suitable for large datasets; interpretation may require explanation.

- **Analysis:** Compares multiple attributes or variables across categories.  
- **Uses:** Skill assessment, performance evaluation, product feature comparison.  
- **Advantages:** Visualizes multidimensional data effectively.  
- **Disadvantages:** Hard to read with many variables; differences may be subtle.

---

## 13. Funnel Chart

- **Analysis:** Highlights conversion rates, drop-offs, and bottlenecks.  
- **Uses:** Sales pipeline, recruitment funnel, website conversion analysis.  
- **Advantages:** Highlights areas needing improvement; visually simple.  
- **Disadvantages:** Not suitable for detailed data; cannot show exact values clearly.

---

## 14. Gauge / Dial Chart
- **Description:** Circular chart with a pointer to indicate progress or performance.  
- **Analysis:** Tracks a metric against a target or benchmark.  
- **Uses:** KPI monitoring, performance metrics, progress tracking.  
- **Advantages:** Quickly communicates performance status.
